# Cloudify Manager Inputs
# # # # # # # # # # # # #

# The IP address of the Cloudify Manager.

# Denotes whether Cloudify Manager has security enabled. In that case, one must
# set `manager_secure` to `true` and provide the username and password required
# for authentication.

# Denotes whether SSL is enabled and the Cloudify Manager's certificate should

# The endpoint of Cloudify Manager's RabbitMQ server. This set of parameters is
# required by the AMQP Middleware in order to be able to connect to RabbitMQ.
# The `rabbitmq_host` defaults to `manager_host`, unless provided. If security
# is enabled, RabbitMQ listens by default at port 5671.

# Specifies the username and password to be used in order to connect to
# Cloudify Manager's RabbitMQ server.
#rabbitmq_username: 'cloudify'

# If RabbitMQ server has SSL enabled, set `rabbitmq_ssl_enabled` to `true`. The
# following option is enabled for secure Cloudify Manager installations. In any
# case, users SHOULD NOT have to modify the `rabbitmq_cert_public` path.

# By default, users are required to provide a name and an e-mail address in
# order to create a new account.

# Alternatively, in case one wants to:
# 1. use an existing account or
# 2. install additional AMQP Middleware(s) under the same account,
# then `user_exists` must be set to `true`. In that case, an authentication
# token has to be provided. Tokens can be retrieved by executing `cfy local
# outputs` at an existing installation of the AMQP Middleware.
